Here 4 stages , diseased or not and also 2 stages
1st row - age
2 row  -  male or female (1 - male)
3 -  chest pain CP
    cp: chest pain type
        -- Value 1: typical angina(Chest portion)
        -- Value 2: atypical angina
        -- Value 3: non-anginal pain
        -- Value 4: asymptomatic
4 - trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the 
        hospital)
5 -  chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6 - fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)  (1 = true; 0 = false)
7 -  restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
        -- Value 0: normal
        -- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST 
                    elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
        -- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy
                    by Estes' criteria
8 -  thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
9 - exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10 - oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11 - slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
        -- Value 1: upsloping
        -- Value 2: flat
        -- Value 3: downsloping

12 - ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13 - thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
14 - num: diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)
        -- Value 0: < 50% diameter narrowing
        -- Value 1: > 50% diameter narrowing
        (in any major vessel: attributes 59 through 68 are vessels)
